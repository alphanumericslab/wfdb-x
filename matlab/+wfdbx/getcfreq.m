function f = getcfreq()
%GETCFREQ Counter frequency of the open record.
%   F = wfdbx.getcfreq() returns the counter frequency (Hz), or the frame
%   frequency if no counter frequency was defined.

%   See also wfdbx.setcfreq, wfdbx.getbasecount.
%
%   Translation of the C function getcfreq() (lib/signal.c, WFDB 10.7.0):
%   same arguments and results.

% This file is part of WFDB-x, an independent reimplementation of the WFDB
% Software Package in Python, C++, MATLAB/Octave, Rust, Julia, R and Kotlin.
%
% It is a MATLAB/Octave translation of lib/signal.c from the WFDB Software
% Package 10.7.0, by George B. Moody. The translation follows the logic and
% behavior of the original code, but it is new code, not the original C
% code.
%
% Changes from the original: none, apart from the language.
%
% Original C code: lib/signal.c, WFDB Software Package 10.7.0.
